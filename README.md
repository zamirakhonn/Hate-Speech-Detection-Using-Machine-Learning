# Hate Speech Detection Project ðŸ¤¬

This project aims to detect hate speech in text using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).
Hate speech refers to any speech that disparages a group of people based on race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
The goal of this project is to create a system that can identify harmful and derogatory language,
ultimately helping to prevent its spread and minimize the negative impacts such as anxiety, fear, and violence.

## About

The purpose of this project is to build a model that detects hate speech from text data. Hate speech, 
which can lead to serious social and legal consequences, can be identified through patterns in language such as certain keywords, 
offensive phrases, and specific sentence structures. In this project, we leverage Pythonâ€™s **NumPy** and **Pandas** libraries for data manipulation and analysis. 
Machine learning models will be used to classify text into "hate speech" or "non-hate speech."

## Features ðŸš€

- **Hate Speech Classification**: Classifies text into hate speech or non-hate speech categories.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Uses Pandas for cleaning, tokenizing, and processing text data.
- **Model Training**: Implements machine learning algorithms to build a model for hate speech detection.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's accuracy and precision using standard metrics.

## Technologies Used ðŸ¦„

- **NumPy**: Used for handling numerical data and performing matrix operations during model training.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing, especially for cleaning and transforming the text data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression or Naive Bayes for classification.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: To tokenize and process text for feature extraction.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch** (optional): For more advanced machine learning or deep learning models.
